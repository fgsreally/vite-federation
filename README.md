# vite-federation

**English** | [‰∏≠Êñá](./README.zh-CN.md)

A module federation scheme based on VITE implementation, inspired by Webpack5 federation. Supports ESM format only.

###### Features

- üíö Dock module can statically compile/dynamically import remote modules (depending on requirements)
- ‚ú® has no impact on the original project converted to remote modules (either development or production environment)
- ‚ö°Ô∏è Fewer requests than Webpack module federation (for both development and production environments)
- üèù free call remote module (even if they don't transform base module, can without intrusion used in tools such as low code)
- ü™ê can handle split CSS correctly,provide type support
- ü¶æ can use cache or hot update
- üåà can be used in a variety of micro front-end/multi-module solutions
- üòÉ Supports vue, but not just vue

Webpack Module federation is currently not compatible ÔºåIf you insist on using it,<a href="https://github.com/originjs/vite-plugin-federation">vite-plugin-federation</a> may be helpful

## Installation

```bash
npm i vite/federation -D
```

## basic concept

There are two roles, the remote module and the base module. The remote module can be a product project, or it can be a simple library , and the base module receives the modules and uses them.

Note: Due to the features of the Vite development phase, remote modules cannot provide modules to the base in the development environment. They must be packaged later. If you need to change the effect immediately, please use the Watch mode to package

## basic

Overall process: 1 Add micro.js remote.config.ts/js to the remote module
2 Package with remote.config.ts/js
3 Pairs of packaged folders (Remote by default) that are placed on the server and allowed to cross domains
Add the plugin to the base project and use it normally

In the remote module, the following two files need to be added

# remote

```ts
//in micro.js(you can change it)
let app = import("./src/App.vue");
export { app };
```

```ts
//in remote.config.ts(if you use it in vite.config.ts,it will effect origin project bundling )
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import vue from "@vitejs/plugin-vue";
import { remotePlugin } from "vite-federation";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    vue(),
    remotePlugin({
      externals: {
        //Shared packages. If you want a VUE project, you must have a VUE in it. If you want to test only locally, you can use a UUID
        vue: "https://cdn.bootcdn.net/ajax/libs/vue/3.2.33/vue.esm-browser.js", //cdn url
      },
      HMR: {
        projectName: "app",
        homePort: "http://localhost:3000",
      },
      cssSplit: true,
      importMap: true, //This configuration must be the same in the home and remote modules
    }),
  ],
});
```

# home

```ts
//in vite.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import vue from "@vitejs/plugin-vue";
import { homePlugin } from "vite-federation";
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    vue(),
    homePlugin({
      externals: {
        vue: "https://cdn.bootcdn.net/ajax/libs/vue/3.2.33/vue.esm-browser.js", //be the same with remoteModule
      },
      remote: {
        app: "http://127.0.0.1:8080",
      },
      cache: false,
      mode: "hot", //If it is "hot", then the production environment will pack the same effect as the module federation, otherwise("cold") it will be the same as a normal project
      importMap: true,
    }),
  ],
});
```

```ts
import test1 from "@app/app"; // import App.js, depending on how it export in micro.js
import test1 from "@app/App.js"; //import App.js
import "@app/App.css"; //import App.css
```

If import a remote vue component(includes css) and cssSplit option is true

```ts
//in any .vue/jsx/tsx/ts/js files
import test1 from "@app/App";
import "@app/App.css";
```

or

```ts
import test1 from "@app/App.vue";
```

If the css does not exist,it won't break anything

```ts
import "@app/style.css";
```

## run example

```shell
yarn build
yarn build:remote//remote
http-server --cors//remote/remote
yarn dev //home

```

## dynamic import

(not good)
If you don't want to make any changes to the base module and just want to use the dynamically introduced effects, you can add them directly to the existing project manually (CSS also needs to be added manually)
(If and only if production environment works)

```ts
const test = import(/* @vite-ignore */ "http//localhost:8000/App.js");
```

## HMR

If you want to debug both the remote module and the home module, you need to change the HMR config in the remote module, as shown in Example

## importMap

Since it is inherently ESM dependent, it is necessary to ensure that the same dependencies must come from the same source in all parts of the project. If a part of the project, such as the component library, is already packaged on the CDN, and the VUE in the component library does not specify a point, this can be a problem in hot mode packaging.importmap can solve it.

If you feel that ImportMap is not compatible, consider this repository <a href="https://github.com/guybedford/es-module-shims">es-module-shims</a>

## typescript support

For more detail, see Example,
(when the remote module is bundling in watch mode, refreshing in the process of generating the dts will cause a crash
)

## structure

> recommend structure

    |-- dist
    |-- remote(output)
        ...
        |-- remoteEntry.js
        |-- remoteList.json(describe project info)
        |-- types
            |-- micro.d.ts(help "home" find module entry)
            |-- types.json(describe d.ts files )
            ...
    |-- src
        |-- micro.ts (core entry)
        ...
    |-- README.md
    |-- remote.config.ts(federation config)
    |-- vite.config.ts (normal config)
    |-- package.json

## bug

when start devserver in home project,it may cause an error in "vite:dep-scan",which won't effect anything(v0.0.9|vite^3)


## dev

 you can directly use vite dev in remote project, which requires the devplugin to be used on both remote and home, but this is only preview for now and does not support packaging
